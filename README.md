# Portfolio-Page

 This is my portfolio page that I intend to use for my resume in the future. In time, it will have more or be updated and adapted in a new way as I started applying for jobs. 
 
 This project does not need anything special to run other than a text editor. I used brackets to set it up and used Visual Studio Code for other segments as I was adding to the website. 
 
 Ps
 I did commit more than a few things to the master portion. The most recent upload is what needs to be downloaded, as it is temporarily the final edit for the project.
