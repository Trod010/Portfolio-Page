            <p class="t-item">My name is Tony Rodriguez. I have been learning to code since January of 2018. It started off as pure curiosity, but as I have been learning to apply what I have learned, I further see myself continuing along this path and truly making it a career. I currently work in IT, more specifically L2 Services for GE. It certainly has its moments where I can learn and apply, but I do not foresee myself there long. I see myself as a developer. I see myself using these skills that I have acquired to create and maintain and expand. I see myself always striving, always challenging myself and always pursuing my neverending goal of knowledge and the application of such information.</p>
