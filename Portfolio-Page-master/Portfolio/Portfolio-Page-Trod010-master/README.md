# Portfolio-Page

 This is my portfolio page that I intend to use for my resume in the future. In time it will have more or be updated and adapted in a new way as I started applying for jobs. 

 This project does not need anything special to run other than a text editor. I used brackets to set it up and used Visual Studio Code for other segments as I was adding to the website.
